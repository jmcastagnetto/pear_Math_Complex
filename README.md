Math_Complex
===========

Classes that represent and manipulate complex numbers. 

Contain definitions for basic arithmetic functions, as well as 
trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, hyperbolic, inverse 
hyperbolic, exponential and logarithms of complex numbers.

This is old code I wrote for [PEAR](http://pear.php.net). 
Originally it was tracked in CVS, then it was moved to SVN, 
and now I am importing it to git :-)
